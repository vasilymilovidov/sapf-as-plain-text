## Sapf-as-plain*-text
**I know it's not true, but I couldn't resist*

An Editor for [SAPF](https://github.com/lfnoise/sapf).  
Just the beginning.

### How to use
You must have 'sapf' in your path.
Write some sapf code, press CTRL+ENTER to send it to sapf.  
Press CTRL+TAB to call the completions popup.  

### What works
- Basic text editing
- Sending code to sapf's repl
- Code completions and hints

### TODO
- [ ] More keybindings — stop, reinit, clear stack, record
- [ ] Make it pretty — optional syntax highlighting, themes, etc
- [ ] Better completions
- [ ] Buffers
- [ ] Export
- [ ] VIM motions?
